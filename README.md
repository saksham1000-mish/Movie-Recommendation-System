# Movie-Recommender-System
A content based movie recommender system using cosine similarity

## Content Based Recommnder System - 
A Content-Based Recommender works by the data that we take from the user, either explicitly (rating) or implicitly (clicking on a link). By the data we create a user profile, which is then used to suggest to the user, as the user provides more input or take more actions on the recommendation, the engine becomes more accurate.

## Cosine Similarity - 
Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.

## About the Dataset
The dataset for the project is being taken from **Kaggle** - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_credits.csv
This first dataset contains data about 5000 movies and detailed columns such as Genres, Keywords, Overview, Popularity, Production Company,etc
The second datasest containts the details about the cast the crew of the same 5000 movies.
